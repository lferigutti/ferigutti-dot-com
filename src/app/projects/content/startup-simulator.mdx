# Startup Simulator

Startup Simulator is an interactive, role-based experience that lets you "play"
through messy, realistic startup situations. You choose to step into the shoes
of a Founder, Product Manager, or Engineer and make decisions under ambiguity,
trade-offs, and competing priorities.

As you go through branching scenarios, the app builds a lightweight profile of
how you tend to operate in a startup context - from your risk appetite and
ownership mindset to how you communicate and align with others. The goal is not
to label you, but to surface patterns that can spark more honest conversations
about how you like to work.

**Key Features:**

- Role-based paths: distinct scenario flows for Founders, PMs, and Engineers.
- Branching scenario engine with meaningful trade-offs in each decision.
- Under-the-hood trait scoring that maps choices to behaviours (e.g. bias for
  action, collaboration, communication style).
- Archetype summary at the end, with strengths and growth edges based on your
  decisions.
- Single-container deployment so the API and SPA can be shipped together.

**Tech Stack:**

- Backend: FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, managed with uv.
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Router, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
- Infrastructure: Docker multi-stage build with a single image serving both the
  API and the built frontend.
