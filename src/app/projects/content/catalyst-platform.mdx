# Catalyst Platform

Currently building Catalyst at [Phelas](https://phelas.com/) — a SaaS platform
that helps renewable energy professionals make smarter investment decisions
through data-driven simulations and optimization.

The renewable energy landscape is increasingly complex: fluctuating market
prices, evolving regulations, and the growing importance of storage and hybrid
assets. Catalyst cuts through this complexity by providing clear, actionable
insights.

**What Catalyst Does:**

- Models how combinations of assets (battery storage, solar PV, wind, hybrid
  systems) perform under specific market and operational conditions.
- Combines user input data (generation curves, market price forward curves, grid
  constraints) with advanced optimization algorithms.
- Simulates asset operation and calculates expected revenues across different
  market scenarios.

**Key Features:**

- Time resolution at hourly or quarter-hourly intervals for granular analysis.
- Flexible scenario testing to evaluate trade-offs and maximize profitability.
- Clear financial metrics: net revenues, IRR, NPV, and market participation
  breakdowns.

**Who Uses It:**

- Investors and financial institutions assessing risk before committing capital.
- Renewable project developers optimizing asset sizing and project design.
- Independent Power Producers analyzing revenue streams.
- Energy consultants providing clients with robust, transparent analysis.
