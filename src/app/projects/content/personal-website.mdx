# Personal Website

You're looking at it! This is my personal portfolio, a minimal, dark-themed
site inspired by Apple and Linear's design language.

I built this to have a simple, clean home for my projects and to practice
shipping fast. The goal was to create something that feels premium without
being overdesigned.

**Key Features:**

- Minimal Apple-style aesthetic with subtle ambient lighting effects.
- MDX-powered project pages for easy content management.
- Responsive design that works on all devices.
- Fast page loads with Next.js static generation.

**Tech Stack:**

- Framework: Next.js 15 with App Router.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens.
- Content: MDX for project pages with custom components.
- Hosting: Vercel with automatic deployments from GitHub.
- Icons: React Icons for consistent iconography.

**What I Learned:**

Building your own portfolio is a great way to experiment with design decisions
without client constraints. I went through several iterations, from a noisy
"gamer" aesthetic to this cleaner minimal look, and learned that less really
is more.
